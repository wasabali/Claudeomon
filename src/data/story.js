// Story act definitions, dialog trees, and narrative flags.
// Registry pattern: getById('npc_margaret') → { id, pages, variants? }
//
// Dialogue variants are checked before the default `pages`.
// Each variant has a `condition` object with optional fields:
//   reputationMin, reputationMax, shameMin, shameMax
// The first matching variant wins (evaluated top-to-bottom).
//
// Variants may also have a `pool` field (array of pages arrays) instead of
// `pages`. When matched, a random entry from the pool is selected. This is
// used for shame-3 one-liners so players see different reactions each time.
//
// dialogByAct: optional per-act dialog override data keyed by act number
// (1–5) or 'finale'/'postgame'. This file defines the schema only; current
// dialogue resolution uses `variants` and default `pages`.
