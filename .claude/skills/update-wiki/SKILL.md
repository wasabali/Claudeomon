description: Update the Cloud Quest game wiki. Regenerates docs/wiki/ pages from the current game data files and design docs. Invoke when game content changes (e.g. /update-wiki or /update-wiki "added new kubernetes skills").
---

You are updating the Cloud Quest game wiki — a set of markdown pages in `docs/wiki/` that serve as the player-facing knowledge base. The wiki should always reflect the current state of the game data.

## When to run

- After adding new skills, trainers, items, incidents, or encounters
- After changing domain matchups, tiers, or game mechanics
- After adding new regions or hidden areas
- When any game data file in `src/data/` changes
- When asked to by the developer

## Data sources

Read these files to build the wiki. **Always read them fresh** — never use cached content.

| File | Contains |
|---|---|
| `src/data/skills.js` | All skill definitions — commands, domains, tiers, effects, learn locations |
| `src/data/trainers.js` | All trainer NPCs — good and cursed, domains, locations, signature skills |
| `src/data/items.js` | All items — tools, key items, credentials, docs, junk |
| `src/data/encounters.js` | Encounter pools per region + incident definitions |
| `src/data/emblems.js` | Certification emblems and passive bonuses |
| `src/data/quests.js` | Quest definitions |
| `src/data/story.js` | Story dialog and NPC text |
| `src/config.js` | Domain matchups, status effects, XP table, constants |
| `docs/sessions/2026-04-15-game-design.md` | Core design decisions |
| `docs/issues/content-bible.md` | Full content bible — world, characters, story |
| `docs/issues/stackoverflow-wiki.md` | In-game StackOverflow design |

## Wiki structure

The wiki lives in `docs/wiki/`. Maintain these files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Wiki home — table of contents, quick links |
| `getting-started.md` | How to play, controls, first steps, tutorial walkthrough |
| `combat-guide.md` | Battle system, domains, matchup cycle, solution tiers, SLA timers |
| `skills-reference.md` | All skills grouped by domain with stats |
| `world-map.md` | Regions, what's in each, progression order |
| `trainers.md` | All trainers — location, domain, difficulty, signature skill |
| `items-and-inventory.md` | All items by tab with effects |
| `encounters.md` | Encounter pools, incident stats, how random encounters work |
| `emblems.md` | All emblems, domains, passive bonuses |
| `reputation-and-shame.md` | Rep/Shame mechanics, thresholds, evil path overview |
| `tips-and-tricks.md` | Hints for stuck players, general strategy, domain matchup cheatsheet |
| `hidden-areas.md` | Outcast network, discovery hints (spoiler-tagged) |

## Writing rules

1. **Tone**: Friendly, slightly irreverent, matches the game's satirical voice. Write like a fan wiki, not dry docs.
2. **Accuracy**: Every stat, name, and value must come directly from the data files. Never invent content.
3. **Spoiler discipline**: Hidden areas and cursed techniques should be behind spoiler tags or in a clearly marked spoilers section. Don't ruin discovery.
4. **Tables over prose**: Use markdown tables for stats, lists, and references. Players scan, they don't read essays.
5. **Cross-links**: Link between wiki pages using relative markdown links (e.g., `[Combat Guide](combat-guide.md)`).
6. **Keep it current**: If a data file has an entry, it must appear in the wiki. If it doesn't appear in any data file, don't include it.
7. **No code snippets**: This is a player wiki, not a dev reference. Don't show JS objects or internal field names.
8. **Skill descriptions**: Use the `description` field from skills.js — it's already written in player-friendly flavour text.
9. **Domain matchup diagram**: Always include the full cycle in the combat guide: `Linux → Security → Serverless → Cloud → IaC → Containers → Kubernetes → Linux`.

## Step-by-step process

### Step 1 — Read all data files

Read every file listed in the data sources table above. Do this first, before writing anything.

### Step 2 — Generate each wiki page

For each page in the wiki structure table:
- If the file exists, overwrite it with updated content
- If it doesn't exist, create it
- Follow the writing rules exactly

### Step 3 — Update the README

The `docs/wiki/README.md` must list all wiki pages with descriptions and links. Update it last so it reflects any new pages.

### Step 4 — Verify

- [ ] Every skill in `skills.js` appears in `skills-reference.md`
- [ ] Every trainer in `trainers.js` appears in `trainers.md`
- [ ] Every item in `items.js` appears in `items-and-inventory.md`
- [ ] Every emblem in `emblems.js` appears in `emblems.md`
- [ ] Every encounter pool in `encounters.js` appears in `encounters.md`
- [ ] Domain matchup cycle is correct and matches `config.js`
- [ ] All wiki pages are linked from `README.md`
- [ ] No broken relative links between wiki pages
- [ ] Spoiler content is properly marked
- [ ] Tone is consistent — friendly, funny, helpful

## Example: skills-reference.md entry

```markdown
### 🐧 Linux

| Skill | Tier | Effect | Where to Learn |
|---|---|---|---|
| `systemctl restart` | Standard | Heals 20 HP. "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" | Ola the Ops Guy, Localhost Town |
| `grep "ERROR" /var/log/*` | Standard | Reveals enemy domain. 10,000 lines of INFO for one ERROR. | Tux the Terminal Wizard, Shell Cavern |
| `kill -9` | Standard | 35 damage, no questions asked. | Ola the Ops Guy, Localhost Town |
```

## Example: hidden areas entry (with spoiler tag)

```markdown
### 🔒 Hidden Areas

The world has secret locations that reward curiosity and disobedience. Finding all of them unlocks something special.

<summary>⚠️ Spoilers — Click to reveal hidden area locations</summary>

| Area | How to Find It |
|---|---|
| The Server Graveyard | SSH into a terminal that looks "dead" |
| The node_modules Maze | Don't discard the junk item — use it instead |
