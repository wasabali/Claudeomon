# Skills Reference

Every skill in Cloud Quest is a real CLI command. This page lists them all, organized by domain.

**Active skill deck limit:** 6 skills. Choose wisely.

> **Note:** Some skill effects described below (e.g., damage-over-time, reveal next moves, confuse, immunity, traps, reflection) are defined in the game data but **not yet fully resolved in battle**. The current BattleEngine processes `damage`, `heal`, and domain reveal effects. Other effect types will be implemented in future updates — for now, treat their descriptions as design intent.
