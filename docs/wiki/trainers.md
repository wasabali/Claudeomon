### Beating Trainers

- **Win** → Trainer teaches you their **signature skill** + XP reward
- **Optimal win** → Full XP (×2 multiplier)
- **Standard win** → Normal XP (×1 multiplier)
- **Shortcut/Cursed/Nuclear win** → Reduced XP, reputation damage

**Tip:** Aim for Optimal solutions — they give double XP even if the signature skill is taught on any win.

## Cursed Trainers

These engineers have gone to the dark side. They hang out in shady corners of the world — mostly **The 3am Tavern** and the hidden **Outcast Network** areas. They teach cursed techniques that are powerful but accumulate **Shame**.

### About Cursed Trainers

- Cursed trainers often require **Shame Points** to access (usually Shame ≥ 2)
- Their techniques bypass domain matchups — they work on everything
- Every cursed technique costs Shame (+1) and Reputation loss
- Nuclear techniques are even worse: +2 Shame, massive rep loss, lasting side effects
- Shame is **permanent** — it never goes down. See [Reputation & Shame](reputation-and-shame.md)
