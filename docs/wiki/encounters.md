# Encounters

Random encounters happen as you explore the world. Each region has its own **encounter pool** divided by rarity. You'll face incidents — technical problems that need solving before the SLA timer runs out.

---

## How Encounters Work

1. As you move through a region, there's a chance of triggering a random encounter
2. The encounter is drawn from the region's pool based on rarity weights:
   - **Common:** 70% chance
   - **Rare:** 25% chance
   - **Cursed:** 5% chance (only if the pool has cursed encounters)
3. You enter battle against the incident
4. The incident shows **symptoms** — you see what's wrong but not the root cause
5. Use an Observability skill to reveal the **domain** — then attack with a matching domain for ×2 damage
6. Resolve it before the **SLA timer** hits 0

## SLA Timer Tips

- **SLA 5:** Plenty of time. Diagnose, plan, execute.
- **SLA 4:** Comfortable. One turn to diagnose, three to resolve.
- **SLA 3:** Tight. Diagnose fast or guess the domain.
- **SLA 2:** Dangerous. You basically need to know the domain already.
- **SLA 1:** SEV0. One shot. Good luck.

Use `PagerDuty acknowledge` to pause the SLA timer for 2 turns — it can save you in tight situations.
