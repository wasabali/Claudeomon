# [Content] Game Content Bible — Story, World, Characters, Items & Names

A single reference issue consolidating all content decisions scattered across #33–#50 and the existing data files. This is the **pick-and-choose menu** — nothing here is final until checked off. Items marked with ✅ are already in the codebase or confirmed in previous issues; everything else is a proposal.

## 1 · Story — Acts & Narrative Beats

### Act Structure (5 acts + prologue/epilogue)

| Act | Title Proposal | Summary | Status |
|-----|----------------|---------|--------|
| **Prologue** | "Hello World" | Professor Pedersen's lab. Pick a name, choose a starter deck (3 domains to pick from), learn basic commands. First battle: a `404 Not Found` incident on the campus Wi-Fi. | Partially defined |
| **Act 1** | "Push to Production" | Explore Localhost Town → Pipeline Pass → first gym. Deploy Old Margaret's bakery site. Learn CI/CD basics. End trigger: first successful prod deploy. | Partially defined |
| **Act 2** | "It Works on My Machine" | App goes viral. Cross into Staging Valley and Production Plains. THROTTLEMASTER's first interference (sabotages a pipeline). The 3:17am crisis moment. Second and third gyms. | Outlined in #34 |
| **Act 3** | "Legacy Migration" | OldCorp contracts NorCloud to migrate legacy services. Enter Jira Dungeon and the Kubernetes Colosseum. Discover `DO_NOT_TOUCH.exe`. Fourth and fifth gyms. Kristoffer starts acting suspicious. | Outlined in #34/#37 |
| **Act 4** | "Root Cause Analysis" | THROTTLEMASTER unmasked as Kristoffer's bitter ex-colleague. Sixth and seventh gyms. Architecture District and Security Vault. Reputation gates tighten. | Outlined in #34/#47 |
| **Finale** | "The Post-Mortem" | Eighth gym (The CTO, three-phase fight). Promoted to Principal Engineer. Credits roll over chiptune Azure theme. Post-credits: Azure Monitor pager buzz. | Outlined in #38 |
| **Evil Ending** | "Fork the Company" | At Shame ≥ 15, join THROTTLEMASTER. Run a rival consultancy. Post-credits: enormous Azure bill. | Outlined in #47 |

### Open story questions to resolve

- [ ] What triggers act transitions — quest completion, gym count, or story flags?
- [ ] Are there cutscenes between acts or just dialogue + world changes?
- [ ] Does the player get a "point of no return" warning before the finale?
- [ ] Is there post-game content after beating The CTO? (gym rematches, harder encounters, new areas)

## 2 · World — Regions & Locations

### Region Map (proposal — 12 main regions + 7 hidden)

| # | Region | Domain | Act | Gym? | Vibe | Status |
|---|--------|--------|-----|------|------|--------|
| 1 | **Localhost Town** | — | Prologue/1 | — | Starting village. Professor Pedersen's lab, Old Margaret's bakery, your apartment. Safe zone, no random encounters. | ✅ In data |
| 2 | **Pipeline Pass** | IaC | 1 | 1st gym | Mountain trail with CI/CD terminals. Failed builds spark as random encounters. | ✅ In data |
| 3 | **Staging Valley** | Cloud | 2 | — | A mirror of production that's slightly broken. Environment tokens required to enter. | Referenced |
| 4 | **Production Plains** | Cloud | 2 | 2nd gym | Wide open grassland with real traffic. High CPU and disk full encounters. | ✅ In data |
| 5 | **Jira Dungeon** | Observability | 3 | 3rd gym | Underground maze of tickets and sprint boards. Stale tickets attack you. | ✅ In data |
| 6 | **Shell Cavern** | Linux | 3 | — | Dark cave illuminated by terminal glow. Tux the Terminal Wizard's domain. | Referenced |
| 7 | **The Helm Repository** | Kubernetes | 3 | 4th gym | A library of charts and releases. Helm Hansen guards the stacks. | Referenced |
| 8 | **Kubernetes Colosseum** | Kubernetes | 3 | 5th gym | Amphitheatre where pods battle for resources. CrashLoopBackOff is the house champion. | ✅ In data |
| 9 | **Security Vault** | Security | 4 | 6th gym | Locked-down fortress. IAM checks at every door. | Referenced |
| 10 | **Architecture District** | Observability | 4 | 7th gym | City of whiteboards and UML diagrams. The Solutions Oracle sits at the centre. | Referenced |
| 11 | **Azure Town** | Cloud | 4 | — | Cloud portal come to life. Shops, certificate vendors, budget management. | Referenced |
| 12 | **The Cloud Console** | Cloud | Finale | 8th gym | Final area. The CTO's office at the top. | Referenced |

### Proposed additional locations (pick & choose)

| Location | Domain | Idea |
|----------|--------|------|
| **The Log Stream** | Observability | A river of scrolling logs. Fish for error messages. Side quest: find the one ERROR in 10,000 INFO lines. |
| **npm Registry Market** | Containers | Bazaar where you trade packages. Some vendors sell deprecated modules. Risk of supply-chain attack encounters. |
| **The Standby Zone** | Serverless | Everything is frozen until you interact with it. Cold start delays on every action. |
| **OldCorp Basement** | — | Act 3 dungeon. Legacy VB6 systems. `DO_NOT_TOUCH.exe` lives here. Flickering fluorescent lights. Smells of 2003. |
| **The War Room** | — | End-game area that opens during SEV1 incidents. Timer on screen. Multiple engineers NPC allies appear. |
| **Certificate Authority Island** | Security | Optional area. Solve crypto puzzles to earn credentials. |
| **DNS Swamp** | Linux | Everything resolves to the wrong address. Navigation is reversed/randomised. |
| **The Backlog Graveyard** | Observability | Side area off Jira Dungeon. Closed tickets come back as ghosts (re-opened bugs). |

### Hidden areas (from #48 — confirmed design)

| # | Area | Discovery Method | Outcast Trainer | Teaches |
|---|------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| H1 | The Server Graveyard | SSH into a "dead" terminal | Deprecated Dagfinn | `terraform destroy` |
| H2 | The node_modules Maze | Use the junk item instead of discarding | Privileged Petra | `docker run --privileged` |
| H3 | The /dev/null Void | Pipe to `/dev/null` 3× in one battle | The Null Pointer | `history -c` |
| H4 | The 3am Tavern | Real clock 02:57–03:05 | Rotating (Shame-gated) | Multiple |
| H5 | Deprecated Azure Region (West-EU-2) | Select greyed-out region from terminal | West-EU-2 Wilhelm | `az feature register --namespace Microsoft.Legacy` |
| H6 | DO_NOT_TOUCH.exe | Open it despite every NPC saying not to | — (notes only) | `EXEC xp_cmdshell` |
| H7 | THROTTLEMASTER's Workstation | Find all 6 above | — | Full backstory |

### Open world questions to resolve

- [ ] How many maps total for MVP? (proposal: 6 main + 2 hidden = 8 for MVP)
- [ ] Region transitions: edge-scroll, world map, or fast-travel terminals?
- [ ] Does the world change between acts? (e.g., Production Plains catches fire in Act 2)
- [ ] Are there day/night cycles or just the real-clock 3am Tavern trick?

| 2 | **The Uptime Arena** | **Captain Nines** (new) _or_ **The On-Call Champion** | Cloud | 2 | `blue-green deploy` | Obsessed with 99.999% uptime. Timer runs during the fight — must win within SLA. Production Plains area. |
| 3 | **The Sprint Sanctum** | **Scrum Siri** (new) _or_ **The Gantt Guardian** | Observability | 2 | `az monitor alert` | Tracks your moves on a kanban board. Gains power for each turn you "waste." Jira Dungeon area. |
| 4 | **The Container Yard** | **Docker Dag** (new) _or_ **The Image Inspector** | Containers | 3 | `docker build` | Fights using layered defences (like image layers). Each layer must be stripped. Helm Repository area. |
| 5 | **The Cluster Ring** | **The Kube-rnetes Master** | Kubernetes | 3 | `kubectl apply -f` | Pod respawns 3× before final defeat. Kubernetes Colosseum area. ✅ Exists |

| 7 | **The Whiteboard Summit** | **The Solutions Oracle** _or_ **Architect Aleksander** (new) | Observability | 4 | `az monitor alert` | Multi-phase design review. You propose, they challenge. Architecture District area. ✅ Exists as trainer |
| 8 | **The Executive Suite** | **The CTO** | — (all domains) | Finale | Phase-dependent | Three phases: "Why is the site down?" (Cloud) / "Why does this cost so much?" (FinOps) / "Why didn't we just use Excel?" (Legacy). Adapts to your shame level. The Cloud Console area. |

### Gym mechanics (pick & choose per gym)

| Mechanic | Description | Proposed gym |

| **Review Board** | Must answer a design question correctly before damage applies | Whiteboard Summit |
| **Build Queue** | Boss queues 3 moves ahead — you see them and must counter | Pipeline Dojo |
| **Budget Burn** | Every turn costs budget; run out and you auto-lose | Executive Suite |

### Open gym questions to resolve

- [ ] Resolve the Function Witch conflict — is she a gym leader or a field trainer? (Currently Fatima is a field trainer in Pipeline Pass)
- [ ] How many apprentice fights before each leader? (proposal: 2 apprentices + 1 sub-leader + boss)
- [ ] Can gyms be re-challenged after beating them? At higher difficulty?
- [ ] Do gym leaders have dialogue that changes based on reputation/shame?

| Name | Role | Location | Idea |
|------|------|----------|------|

| **The Intern** (Intern Ivan) | Comic relief / roaming | Everywhere | Appears in every region asking increasingly absurd questions. "What is a container?" → "What is a Kubernetes?" → "What is the cloud?" → "What is a computer?" Final question: "What is infrastructure?" |

## 7 · Naming Conventions & Themes

### Character naming rules (observed patterns)

| Category | Pattern | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Good trainers** | Scandinavian first name + tech title | Ola the Ops Guy, Ingrid the IAM Inspector, Helm Hansen |
| **Cursed trainers** | Alliterative Scandinavian name + bad practice | Hotfix Håkon, Skip-Tests Sigrid, Merge Magda, Hardcode Henrik |
| **Gym leaders** | "The [Title]" format | The Kube-rnetes Master, The CTO, The Solutions Oracle |
| **Side quest NPCs** | Alliterative English name + role hint | Dev Dave, Budget Barry, Nervous Nancy, Startup Steve |
| **Story NPCs** | Realistic Scandinavian names | Professor Pedersen, Kristoffer |
| **Outcast trainers** | Scandinavian name + deprecated/dark tech ref | Deprecated Dagfinn, West-EU-2 Wilhelm, rm-rf Rune |

### Proposed naming guidelines

- **Trainers:** Keep the Scandinavian flavour — the game is set at NorCloud AS (Norwegian cloud consultancy). Mix in tech puns.
- **Locations:** Cloud/DevOps terminology made physical — `Pipeline Pass`, `Security Vault`, `Production Plains`. Should sound like real places a hiker would visit.
- **Items:** Real tool names where possible (`SSH Key`, `Terraform State`). Consumables get punny names (`Rollback Potion`, `Azure Credit Voucher`).
- **Encounters:** Real error messages or ops jargon (`CrashLoopBackOff`, `503 Service Unavailable`, `OOM Kill`).
- **Skills:** Actual CLI commands verbatim (`kubectl apply -f`, `docker build`, `git push --force`).

### Reputation titles (confirmed in #46)

| Reputation | Title |
|------------|-------|
| 80–100 | Distinguished Engineer |
| 60–79 | Competent Engineer |
| 40–59 | Adequate Engineer |
| 20–39 | Liability |
| 0–19 | Walking Incident |

### Shame titles (proposal — pick & choose)

| Shame | Title | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0 | Clean Record | — |
| 1–2 | "It Was Like That When I Got Here" | First cursed trainer visible |
| 3–4 | Cowboy Coder | Trainers fight harder |
| 5–6 | The Shortcutter | 3am Tavern populated, full cursed trainer access |
| 7–9 | Person of Interest | THROTTLEMASTER contacts you |
| 10–14 | Shadow Engineer | Alternate ending accessible, Helm Hansen refuses to teach |
| 15+ | The Other Principal | Can join THROTTLEMASTER at final boss |

## 9 · THROTTLEMASTER — Villain Detail Proposals

**Real Name:** Proposals (pick one):
- **Karsten** — "Karsten was your colleague once. Now he's everyone's problem."
- **Klaus** — Short, sharp, slightly sinister.
- **Kåre** — Traditional Norwegian, ironic for a disruptive villain.

**Appearance ideas:**
- Hooded figure with a glowing terminal for a face
- Normal-looking engineer in a hoodie, but everything around them is rate-limited
- Wears a lanyard from "OmniCloud Corp" — a company that was shut down

**Motivation:** Was passed over for promotion at OmniCloud despite being the best engineer. Became disillusioned. Decided if the cloud can't be fair, he'll throttle everyone to his level. His tools: rate limiting, resource exhaustion, artificial scarcity.

**World presence ideas:**
- Sabotaged terminals found in various regions (flavour text)
- Rate-limited encounters (enemy gets extra turns) in areas he's tampered with
- NPCs mention "someone's been throttling the network" as early as Act 1
- Leaves calling cards: `/* THROTTLEMASTER WAS HERE */` comments in code terminals

## 10 · Starter Deck Proposals

The player picks their starting domain in the prologue. Each choice gives a different starting deck of 3 skills.

| Starter | Skills | Vibe |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Linux Starter** | `systemctl restart`, `grep logs`, `blame DNS` | "You chose the terminal. Bold." |
| **Cloud Starter** | `az webapp deploy`, `feature flag`, `blue-green deploy` | "The cloud calls. Your wallet weeps." |
| **IaC Starter** | `git revert`, `az pipelines run`, `bicep deploy` | "Infrastructure as Code. What could go wrong?" |

### Open starter questions

- [ ] Three starters or more? (proposal: 3, one per classic RPG archetype — defensive/offensive/balanced)
- [ ] Does your starter choice affect the early game difficulty curve?
- [ ] Are starter skills permanently in your deck or can they be swapped out?
